# 👋 Hi, I’m Digvijay — Here’s What I Build

Welcome to my professional project showcase 👨‍💻  
This repository is a curated overview of real-world web projects I’ve built for businesses and academic use.

I enjoy turning ideas into clean, functional web applications that actually get used.

> I’m always happy to walk through the architecture and decisions during an interview or discussion.
